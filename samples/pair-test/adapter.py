class BTAdapter(BTInterface):
    """
    Wrapper around dbus to encapsulate org.bluez.adapter interface.
    :param str adapter_path: Object path to bluetooth adapter.
        If not given, can use adapter_id instead.
    :param str adapter_id: Adapter's MAC address to look-up to find
        path e.g., '11:22:33:44:55:66'
    :Properties:
    * **Address(str) [readonly]**: The Bluetooth device address
        of the adapter.
    * **Name(str) [readonly]**: The Bluetooth system name
        (pretty hostname).
        This property is either a static system default
        or controlled by an external daemon providing
        access to the pretty hostname configuration.
    * **Alias(str) [readwrite]**: The Bluetooth friendly name.
        This value can be changed.
        In case no alias is set, it will return the system
        provided name. Setting an empty string as alias will
        convert it back to the system provided name.
        When resetting the alias with an empty string, the
        property will default back to system name.
        On a well configured system, this property never
        needs to be changed since it defaults to the system
        name and provides the pretty hostname. Only if the
        local name needs to be different from the pretty
        hostname, this property should be used as last
        resort.
    * **Class(uint32) [readonly]**: The Bluetooth class of
        device.
        This property represents the value that is either
        automatically configured by DMI/ACPI information
        or provided as static configuration.
    * **Powered(boolean) [readwrite]**: Switch an adapter on or
        off. This will also set the appropriate connectable
        state of the controller.
        The value of this property is not persistent. After
        restart or unplugging of the adapter it will reset
        back to false.
    * **Discoverable(boolean) [readwrite]**: Switch an adapter
        to discoverable or non-discoverable to either make it
        visible or hide it. This is a global setting and should
        only be used by the settings application.
        If DiscoverableTimeout is set to a non-zero
        value then the system will set this value back to
        false after the timer expired.
        In case the adapter is switched off, setting this
        value will fail.
        When changing the Powered property the new state of
        this property will be updated via a
        :py:attr:`.BTInterface.SIGNAL_PROPERTY_CHANGED`
        signal.
        For any new adapter this settings defaults to false.
    * **Pairable(boolean) [readwrite]**: Switch an adapter to
        pairable or non-pairable. This is a global setting and
        should only be used by the settings application.
    * **PairableTimeout(uint32) [readwrite]**:
        The pairable timeout in seconds. A value of zero
        means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in
        pairable mode forever.
        The default value for pairable timeout should be
        disabled (value 0).
    * **DiscoverableTimeout(uint32) [readwrite]**:
        The discoverable timeout in seconds. A value of zero
        means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in
        discoverable/limited mode forever.
        The default value for the discoverable timeout should
        be 180 seconds (3 minutes).
    * **Discovering(boolean) [readonly]**:
        Indicates that a device discovery procedure is active.
    * **UUIDs(array{str}) [readonly]**:
        List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available
        local services.
    * **Modalias(str) [readonly, optional]**:
        Local Device ID information in modalias format
        used by the kernel and udev.
